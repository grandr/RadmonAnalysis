- fillCsv2ntuple.py - converts fill csv file to root ntuple (1 file per fill)
- mergeWithLumi.py  - merges radmon data with lumi data into one ntuple (1 file per fill). Time step = 1 lumi section
- lumiRateGraphs.py - make GraphErrors for "Selected Lumi" (bcmf etc) vs neutron rate for all detectors and fit them to the linear dependence
- plotFillLumi.py  - plot Bril luminosity and normalized mean luminosity from RBX neutron detectors. Calibration factors and setup is in lumiCalibration.ini
- plotFillLumiMerged.py - the same as above but from combined radmonlumifiles (bin = ls) - old version. Might not be working and actually not needed.
